## Welcome to My Expanded Code Review
To see it in action - text Code to (430)259-2418. You'll be presented with a link to an intro video. 
Text 1 to see the menu of different walkthroughs for my code in [StoryBoard](https://github.com/Callmich/storyboard)

### How Did This Come About?
I am currently applying to Twilio's Hatch program for the position of Software Engineer Apprentice. Before I applied I wanted to get a feel and basic understanding of the technology they offer their clients. I came across a guide to get started. [Link](https://www.twilio.com/docs/sms)
From there I asked myself - What can I do that would be able to do that would show Twilio a bit more about myself and my passion for the field? Then it hit me, I needed to submit a 5-minute code review as part of the application. But 5 minutes is a short time to cover a program and there are so many aspects I wanted to show off and talk about. What if I had a bit of fun and made an expanded code review using this awesome technology?

I hope you enjoy it as much as I enjoyed putting it together.

### Tech/Languages Used:
Node.js | Twilio Magic | YouTube

### Plans Moving Forward:
I'll be updating the wording of the texts being sent and also finishing up the items in the SECRET MENU. Lastly, I'll be investigating different ways to approach the large if/else if statement in the server.js. I'd like to be able to clean that up and make it a tad easier to read.

### Build Instructions for a LocalHost:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/Callmich/twilio_explore`
2. Make sure you have a Twilio Account
3. Navigate to the directory: `cd twilio_explore`
4. Install the necessary dependencies: `npm install`
5. Add a .env file with the needed information (bellow)
6. Start the server with `npm start`

In all honesty - if this will be your first time using Twilio - check out their docs and guides. They are the best way to start!

### Information Needed in the .env File:
`AUTH_TOKEN = "Your Twilio Authentication Number"`
`ACCOUNT = "Your Twilio Account Number"`
`SEND_NUM = "+Your Twilio Phone Number"`
`REC_NUM = "+Your Phone Number"`
`PORT = "A LocalHost Port of your Choosing"`


### Feedback:
Do you have any suggestions for refactoring the code or additional features you'd like to see implemented? Please feel free to reach out to me on [GitHub](https://github.com/Callmich) or my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-callahan-webdev/). Looking forward to hearing from you and talking code! 

### Thanks:
A big thanks to the Twilio customer service rep I spoke with when running into issues deploying (thanks, Dom!) and also to Twilio for making this phenomenal technology. Plus a big thanks to my friends that gave it a spin to make sure everything was coming over correctly.
